# Example of logistic regression with two input features
  - `Problem`: Imagine you are trying to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on two factors:
  - `Feature 1 (Hours Studied)`: The number of hours the student spent studying.
  - `Feature 2 (Previous Grade)`: The student's grade in the previous related course (e.g., on a scale of 0 to 100).
  - `Goal`: Build a logistic regression model that takes these two features as input and predicts the probability of the student passing the exam (e.g., Pass = 1, Fail = 0).

# Model
  - The logistic regression model with two features can be represented as follows

##  Linear Combination
  - First, we calculate a linear combination of the input features and their corresponding coefficients (weights) and an intercept (bias)
  - z = β₀ + β₁ * Hours Studied + β₂ * Previous Grade
  - Where:
    + z is the linear combination.
    + β₀ is the intercept (bias).
    + β₁ is the coefficient for "Hours Studied".
    + β₂ is the coefficient for "Previous Grade".

## Sigmoid function
  - Then, we apply the sigmoid function to this linear combination to get the probability of the student passing the exam
  - P(Pass = 1) = σ(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))
  - Where:
    + P(Pass = 1) is the probability of the student passing the exam.
    + σ(z) is the sigmoid function, which outputs a value between 0 and 1.
    + exp(-z) is the exponential function of -z.

# Example data
| Hours Studied | Previous Grade | Pass (1) / Fail (0) |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| 2 |	60	| 0 |
| 3	| 70	| 0 |
| 6	| 85	| 1 |
| 8	| 90	| 1 |
| 4	| 75	| 0 |
| 7	| 80	| 1 |

# Find all x1, and x2 that make y = 0.5
  - To find all values of x₁ and x₂ that will make the predicted probability y = 0.5 in a logistic regression model with two features, we need to set the output of the sigmoid function to 0.5 and solve for the relationship between x₁ and x₂.
  - Recall the logistic regression equation: y = 1 / (1 + exp(-(β₀ + β₁ * x₁ + β₂ * x₂)))
  - Where:
    + y is the predicted probability (which we want to be 0.5).
    + β₀ is the intercept.
    + β₁ is the coefficient for x₁.
    + β₂ is the coefficient for x₂.
  - Solve the equation y=0.5, we get: β₀ + β₁ * x₁ + β₂ * x₂ = 0
  - If β₂ ≠ 0, we get: x₂ = (-β₀ - β₁ * x₁) / β₂
  - The equation x₂ = (-β₀ - β₁ * x₁) / β₂ will draw the line that seperate 2 categories with threshold y = 0.5
